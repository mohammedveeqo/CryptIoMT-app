    detailedDescription: "When implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity IoMT asset management program, a detailed inventory of networked and networkable devices must be developed. This may require a physical inventory that may include the documentation of IP and MAC addresses, operating system, software versions and device types. Existing Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) data extract are ingested, and data is normalized so that qualitative or quantitative asset valuations can take place. The integration of asset valuation into a Clinical Engineering&apos;s IoMT program allows for the prioritization assets based on criticality, value and potential business impact. This ensures that Clinical Engineering resources are directed to interrogate IoMT devices with a high financial, patient care, and operational impact. A Data Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) type assessment is conducted against IoMT devices to further identify, evaluate potential privacy risks while ensuring security mandates from regulatory bodies like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are understood."

    detailedDescription: "Upon a thorough inventory of networked and networkable medical devices, a security risk analysis should be conducted to assess and prioritize risk while leveraging the qualitative/quantitative report and Privacy Impact Assessment. These perquisites are instrumental in formulating a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) that will aid in the identification of valuable assets, potential threats and vulnerabilities. The BIA will help determine the likelihood of threat exploitation and potential impact to the organization driving informed decision-making and prioritization of resources to reduce risk to an acceptable level minimizing disruption of critical business functions. The Risk Analysis is accomplished by leveraging industry standardized methodologies utilized in Information systems organizations such as, NIST SP 800-37, Risk Management Frameworks (RFM) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This helps align the medical device security program with methodologies that Information Security teams and Organizational Governance such as CISO&apos;s understand. Risk Management Frameworks allow proactive security, risk-based decision making, compliance support (HIPAA, NIST & FDA alignment), and continuous monitoring."

Previously completed analytics have brought visibility and should ensure security of the medical device throughout the product lifecycle. Security gaps such as lack of patching or security updates ae identified and compensating controls such as firewall rules and segmentation based on vendor recommendations can be enforced. Manufacturer Disclosure Statement for Medical Device Security (MDS2) forms developed by NENA are provided by healthcare manufacturers for healthcare organizations with information about the medical device&apos;s security features and capabilities will be incorporated as a part of the security control process. MDS2&apos;s inform healthcare organizations about a medical device&apos;s security controls, such as patch management, encryption, and remote access, to help them evaluate risks and make informed purchasing decisions. Cyber Hygiene guidelines will be shared advising on the implementation of strong passwords, access controls, network segmentation, and regular software updates. Risk Management consisting of regularly scheduled risk audits on medical devices will be presented as part of a continuous postmarked surveillance protocol. A Medical Device Cybersecurity Plan will be developed to ensure that monitoring or predefine risk controls is effective and updates to these controls take place as needed. A patching cadence will be established for medical devices identified with high asset valuation as determined by the qualitative/quantitative findings. A well-executed Comprehensive Healthcare IoMT Cybersecurity program is crucial in ensuring patients are protected from harm, ensuring data privacy, and maintaining the availability of healthcare services."
